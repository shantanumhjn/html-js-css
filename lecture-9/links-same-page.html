        Welcome to the room of people <br>
        Who have rooms of people that they loved one day <br>
        Docked away <br>
        Just because we check the guns at the door <br>
        Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades <br>
        You're lovin' on the psychopath sitting next to you <br>
        You're lovin' on the murderer sitting next to you <br>
        You'll think, how'd I get here, sitting next to you? <br>

        They say newcomers have a certain smell <br>
        Yeah, I trust issues, not to mention <br>
        They say they can smell your intentions <br>
        You're lovin' on the freakshow sitting next to you <br>
        You'll have some weird people sitting next to you <br>
        You'll think "how did I get here, sitting next to you?" <br>
